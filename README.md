# DevOps Days 2020 Warsaw - Tanka workshop

To effectively take part in the workshop, all you really need is a computer with Docker installed. We will provide a container with all the tools that you might need and instructions for installation if you want to have tools installed locally.
We will be using a Kubernetes cluster created using kind, but you can use your own cluster, too.

Some knowledge of Helm and Kubernetes will be useful, but you don't have to be a certified professional to join us.

All information will be available before the event on GitHub: https://github.com/ninefiveslabs/workshop-dod2020-warsaw.
